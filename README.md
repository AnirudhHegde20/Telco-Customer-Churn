### Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

#### Introduction

Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's products or services, is a significant challenge for many businesses. Understanding and predicting churn can help companies take proactive steps to retain customers, thereby reducing loss of revenue and improving long-term profitability. This project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing behavioral and demographic data using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the project identifies key factors contributing to churn and develops models to accurately predict which customers are at risk of leaving.

#### Description

This project focuses on the classification of customer churn using various customer-related data points. The process involves meticulous data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to build a robust churn prediction model. The project is implemented using Python, with extensive use of its libraries to clean the data, explore correlations, and evaluate the performance of different models, ultimately selecting the most effective one for predicting churn.

#### Objectives

- To clean and prepare the customer churn dataset for analysis.
- To visualize and analyze customer behavior and its correlation with churn.
- To build and compare multiple machine learning models for churn prediction.
- To evaluate model performance and select the best model for accurate predictions.

#### Data Source

The primary dataset was sourced from a telecommunications company, encompassing various customer attributes and their churn status. The dataset includes 7,043 rows and 21 columns, with a binary target variable indicating whether the customer has churned.

**Data Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle

#### Methodology

**Data Sourcing and Cleaning:**

- Acquired from the telecommunications industry database.
- Extensive preprocessing to handle missing data, duplicates, and outliers.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy) for data visualization and analysis.
- Examined the distribution of customer attributes and their relationship with churn.

**Model Building and Evaluation:**

- Implemented various machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-NN, Na√Øve Bayes, Neural Networks, and Random Forests.
- Performed feature selection using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and chi-square tests for dimensionality reduction.

**Model Performance Evaluation:**

- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance and enhance model performance.

#### Key Findings

- Achieved the highest accuracy of 81% with the Random Forest model.
- Identified significant customer attributes that correlate strongly with churn, such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble methods in improving prediction accuracy.
- Highlighted the impact of customer behavior and demographic factors on churn.

#### Limitations and Future Work

**Limitations:**

- Model reliance on the quality and completeness of customer data.
- Potential biases in the dataset due to regional or demographic factors that were not fully accounted for.

**Future Work:**

- Investigate additional customer attributes and their impact on churn prediction.
- Explore the use of more advanced machine learning techniques such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) or deep learning models.
- Enhance model interpretability to better understand the influence of individual predictors on churn.

#### Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn and demonstrates the application of machine learning for predictive analytics in customer retention. The methodologies and findings can serve as a foundation for further research and the development of more sophisticated churn prediction models, helping businesses to proactively retain their customers and reduce churn rates.
